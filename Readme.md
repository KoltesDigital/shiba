# Shiba

**Work in progress! This is not stable yet. Expect many breaking changes.**

Shiba is a digital content creation tool which aims at:

1. developing in real-time -> final image in Blender viewport with hot reload of sources;
2. being able to produce demos (see [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)) -> supports GLSL, C++, and therefore custom compositing with framebuffers, etc.;
3. easily animating stuff -> use Blender animation features;
4. supporting live coding performances -> feature in progress.
